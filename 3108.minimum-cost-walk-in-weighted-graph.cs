 *
 * There is an undirected weighted graph with n vertices labeled from 0 to n -
 * 1.
 * 
 * You are given the integer n and an array edges, where edges[i] = [ui, vi,
 * wi] indicates that there is an edge between vertices ui and vi with a weight
 * of wi.
 * 
 * A walk on a graph is a sequence of vertices and edges. The walk starts and
 * ends with a vertex, and each edge connects the vertex that comes before it
 * and the vertex that comes after it. It's important to note that a walk may
 * visit the same edge or vertex more than once.
 * 
 * The cost of a walk starting at node u and ending at node v is defined as the
 * bitwise AND of the weights of the edges traversed during the walk. In other
 * words, if the sequence of edge weights encountered during the walk is w0,
 * w1, w2, ..., wk, then the cost is calculated as w0 & w1 & w2 & ... & wk,
 * where & denotes the bitwise AND operator.
 * 
 * You are also given a 2D array query, where query[i] = [si, ti]. For each
 * query, you need to find the minimum cost of the walk starting at vertex si
 * and ending at vertex ti. If there exists no such walk, the answer is -1.
 * 
 * Return the array answer, where answer[i] denotes the minimum cost of a walk
 * for query i.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1,7],[1,3,7],[1,2,1]], query = [[0,3],[3,4]]
 * 
 * Output: [1,-1]
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * 
 * To achieve the cost of 1 in the first query, we need to move on the
 * following edges: 0->1 (weight 7), 1->2 (weight 1), 2->1 (weight 1), 1->3
 * (weight 7).
 * 
 * In the second query, there is no walk between nodes 3 and 4, so the answer
 * is -1.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,2,7],[0,1,15],[1,2,6],[1,2,1]], query = [[1,2]]
 * 
 * Output: [0]
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * 
 * To achieve the cost of 0 in the first query, we need to move on the
 * following edges: 1->2 (weight 1), 2->1 (weight 6), 1->2 (weight 1).
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 2 <= n <= 10^5
 * 0 <= edges.length <= 10^5
 * edges[i].length == 3
 * 0 <= ui, vi <= n - 1
 * ui != vi
 * 0 <= wi <= 10^5
 * 1 <= query.length <= 10^5
 * query[i].length == 2
 * 0 <= si, ti <= n - 1
 * si !=Â ti
