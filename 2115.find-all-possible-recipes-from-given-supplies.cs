 * Testcase Example:  '["bread"]\n[["yeast","flour"]]\n["yeast","flour","corn"]'
 *
 * You have information about n different recipes. You are given a string array
 * recipes and a 2D string array ingredients. The i^th recipe has the name
 * recipes[i], and you can create it if you have all the needed ingredients
 * from ingredients[i]. A recipe can also be an ingredient for other recipes,
 * i.e., ingredients[i] may contain a string that is in recipes.
 * 
 * You are also given a string array supplies containing all the ingredients
 * that you initially have, and you have an infinite supply of all of them.
 * 
 * Return a list of all the recipes that you can create. You may return the
 * answer in any order.
 * 
 * Note that two recipes may contain each other in their ingredients.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: recipes = ["bread"], ingredients = [["yeast","flour"]], supplies =
 * ["yeast","flour","corn"]
 * Output: ["bread"]
 * Explanation:
 * We can create "bread" since we have the ingredients "yeast" and "flour".
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: recipes = ["bread","sandwich"], ingredients =
 * [["yeast","flour"],["bread","meat"]], supplies = ["yeast","flour","meat"]
 * Output: ["bread","sandwich"]
 * Explanation:
 * We can create "bread" since we have the ingredients "yeast" and "flour".
 * We can create "sandwich" since we have the ingredient "meat" and can create
 * the ingredient "bread".
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: recipes = ["bread","sandwich","burger"], ingredients =
 * [["yeast","flour"],["bread","meat"],["sandwich","meat","bread"]], supplies =
 * ["yeast","flour","meat"]
 * Output: ["bread","sandwich","burger"]
 * Explanation:
 * We can create "bread" since we have the ingredients "yeast" and "flour".
 * We can create "sandwich" since we have the ingredient "meat" and can create
 * the ingredient "bread".
 * We can create "burger" since we have the ingredient "meat" and can create
 * the ingredients "bread" and "sandwich".
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * n == recipes.length == ingredients.length
 * 1 <= n <= 100
 * 1 <= ingredients[i].length, supplies.length <= 100
 * 1 <= recipes[i].length, ingredients[i][j].length, supplies[k].length <=
 * 10
 * recipes[i], ingredients[i][j], and supplies[k] consist only of lowercase
 * English letters.
 * All the values of recipes and suppliesÂ combined are unique.
 * Each ingredients[i] does not contain any duplicate values.
