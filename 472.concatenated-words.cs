 * Testcase Example:  '["cat","cats","catsdogcats","dog","dogcatsdog","hippopotamuses","rat","ratcatdogcat"]'
 *
 * Given an array of strings words (without duplicates), return all the
 * concatenated words in the given list of words.
 * 
 * A concatenated word is defined as a string that is comprised entirely of at
 * least two shorter words (not necessarily distinct)Â in the given array.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: words =
 * ["cat","cats","catsdogcats","dog","dogcatsdog","hippopotamuses","rat","ratcatdogcat"]
 * Output: ["catsdogcats","dogcatsdog","ratcatdogcat"]
 * Explanation: "catsdogcats" can be concatenated by "cats", "dog" and "cats"; 
 * "dogcatsdog" can be concatenated by "dog", "cats" and "dog"; 
 * "ratcatdogcat" can be concatenated by "rat", "cat", "dog" and "cat".
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: words = ["cat","dog","catdog"]
 * Output: ["catdog"]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= words.length <= 10^4
 * 1 <= words[i].length <= 30
 * words[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.
 * All the strings of words are unique.
 * 1 <= sum(words[i].length) <= 10^5
 *

 * DFS Top down approach with caching

 * where we loop the no. of words => n
 * and for each word we loop the length => l
 * and we check the prefix and suffix => l
 * for the DFS, we have caching so we can reduce from l^2 => l
