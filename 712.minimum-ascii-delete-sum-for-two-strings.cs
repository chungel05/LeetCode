 * Testcase Example:  '"sea"\n"eat"'
 *
 * Given two strings s1 andÂ s2, return the lowest ASCII sum of deleted
 * characters to make two strings equal.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s1 = "sea", s2 = "eat"
 * Output: 231
 * Explanation: Deleting "s" from "sea" adds the ASCII value of "s" (115) to
 * the sum.
 * Deleting "t" from "eat" adds 116 to the sum.
 * At the end, both strings are equal, and 115 + 116 = 231 is the minimum sum
 * possible to achieve this.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s1 = "delete", s2 = "leet"
 * Output: 403
 * Explanation: Deleting "dee" from "delete" to turn the string into "let",
 * adds 100[d] + 101[e] + 101[e] to the sum.
 * Deleting "e" from "leet" adds 101[e] to the sum.
 * At the end, both strings are equal to "let", and the answer is
 * 100+101+101+101 = 403.
 * If instead we turned both strings into "lee" or "eet", we would get answers
 * of 433 or 417, which are higher.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 1000
 * s1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters.
