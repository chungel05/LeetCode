 *
 * A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a
 * dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... ->
 * sk such that:
 * 
 * 
 * Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
 * Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need
 * to be in wordList.
 * sk == endWord
 * 
 * 
 * Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return
 * all the shortest transformation sequences from beginWord to endWord, or an
 * empty list if no such sequence exists. Each sequence should be returned as a
 * list of the words [beginWord, s1, s2, ..., sk].
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList =
 * ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
 * Output: [["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]]
 * Explanation:Â There are 2 shortest transformation sequences:
 * "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog"
 * "hit" -> "hot" -> "lot" -> "log" -> "cog"
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList =
 * ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
 * Output: []
 * Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no
 * valid transformation sequence.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= beginWord.length <= 5
 * endWord.length == beginWord.length
 * 1 <= wordList.length <= 500
 * wordList[i].length == beginWord.length
 * beginWord, endWord, and wordList[i] consist of lowercase English
 * letters.
 * beginWord != endWord
 * All the words in wordList are unique.
 * The sum of all shortest transformation sequences does not exceed 10^5.
